<h1><br>
 CHRIST IN FLANDERS</h1>

<h1> </h1>

<p>At a dimly remote period in the history of Brabant,
communication<br>
 between the Island of Cadzand and the Flemish coast was kept up
by a<br>
 boat which carried passengers from one shore to the other.
Middelburg,<br>
 the chief town in the island, destined to become so famous in
the<br>
 annals of Protestantism, at that time only numbered some two or
three<br>
 hundred hearths; and the prosperous town of Ostend was an
obscure<br>
 haven, a straggling village where pirates dwelt in security
among the<br>
 fishermen and the few poor merchants who lived in the place.</p>

<p>But though the town of Ostend consisted altogether of some
score of<br>
 houses and three hundred cottages, huts or hovels built of
the<br>
 driftwood of wrecked vessels, it nevertheless rejoiced in
the<br>
 possession of a governor, a garrison, a forked gibbet, a
convent, and<br>
 a burgomaster, in short, in all the institutions of an
advanced<br>
 civilization.</p>

<p><br>
 Who reigned over Brabant and Flanders in those days? On this
point<br>
 tradition is mute. Let us confess at once that this tale
savors<br>
 strongly of the marvelous, the mysterious, and the vague;
elements<br>
 which Flemish narrators have infused into a story retailed so
often to<br>
 gatherings of workers on winter evenings, that the details vary
widely<br>
 in poetic merit and incongruity of detail. It has been told by
every<br>
 generation, handed down by grandames at the fireside, narrated
night<br>
 and day, and the chronicle has changed its complexion somewhat
in<br>
 every age. Like some great building that has suffered many<br>
 modifications of successive generations of architects, some
sombre<br>
 weather-beaten pile, the delight of a poet, the story would
drive the<br>
 commentator and the industrious winnower of words, facts, and
dates to<br>
 despair. The narrator believes in it, as all superstitious minds
in<br>
 Flanders likewise believe; and is not a whit wiser nor more
credulous<br>
 than his audience. But as it would be impossible to make a
harmony of<br>
 all the different renderings, here are the outlines of the
story;<br>
 stripped, it may be, of its picturesque quaintness, but with all
its<br>
 bold disregard of historical truth, and its moral teachings
approved<br>
 by religion--a myth, the blossom of imaginative fancy; an
allegory<br>
 that the wise may interpret to suit themselves. To each his
own<br>
 pasturage, and the task of separating the tares from the
wheat.</p>

<p>The boat that served to carry passengers from the Island of
Cadzand to<br>
 Ostend was upon the point of departure; but before the skipper
loosed<br>
 the chain that secured the shallop to the little jetty, where
people<br>
 embarked, he blew a horn several times, to warn late lingerers,
this<br>
 being his last journey that day. Night was falling. It was
scarcely<br>
 possible to see the coast of Flanders by the dying fires of
the<br>
 sunset, or to make out upon the hither shore any forms of
belated<br>
 passengers hurrying along the wall of the dykes that surrounded
the<br>
 open country, or among the tall reeds of the marshes. The boat
was<br>
 full.</p>

<p>"What are you waiting for? Let us put off!" they cried.</p>

<p>Just at that moment a man appeared a few paces from the jetty,
to the<br>
 surprise of the skipper, who had heard no sound of footsteps.
The<br>
 traveler seemed to have sprung up from the earth, like a peasant
who<br>
 had laid himself down on the ground to wait till the boat
should<br>
 start, and had slept till the sound of the horn awakened him.
Was he a<br>
 thief? or some one belonging to the custom-house or the
police?</p>

<p>As soon as the man appeared on the jetty to which the boat was
moored,<br>
 seven persons who were standing in the stern of the shallop
hastened<br>
 to sit down on the benches, so as to leave no room for the
newcomer.<br>
 It was the swift and instinctive working of the aristocratic
spirit,<br>
 an impulse of exclusiveness that comes from the rich man's
heart. Four<br>
 of the seven personages belonged to the most aristocratic
families in<br>
 Flanders. First among them was a young knight with two
beautiful<br>
 greyhounds; his long hair flowed from beneath a jeweled cap;
he<br>
 clanked his gilded spurs, curled the ends of his moustache from
time<br>
 to time with a swaggering grace, and looked round disdainfully
on the<br>
 rest of the crew. A high-born damsel, with a falcon on her
wrist, only<br>
 spoke with her mother or with a churchman of high rank, who
was<br>
 evidently a relation. All these persons made a great deal of
noise,<br>
 and talked among themselves as though there were no one else in
the<br>
 boat; yet close beside them sat a man of great importance in
the<br>
 district, a stout burgher of Bruges, wrapped about with a vast
cloak.<br>
 His servant, armed to the teeth, had set down a couple of bags
filled<br>
 with gold at his side. Next to the burgher came a man of
learning, a<br>
 doctor of the University of Louvain, who was traveling with his
clerk.<br>
 This little group of folk, who looked contemptuously at each
other,<br>
 was separated from the passengers in the forward part of the
boat by<br>
 the bench of rowers.</p>

<p>The belated traveler glanced about him as he stepped on board,
saw<br>
 that there was no room for him in the stern, and went to the
bows in<br>
 quest of a seat. They were all poor people there. At first sight
of<br>
 the bareheaded man in the brown camlet coat and trunk-hose, and
plain<br>
 stiff linen collar, they noticed that he wore no ornaments,
carried no<br>
 cap nor bonnet in his hand, and had neither sword nor purse at
his<br>
 girdle, and one and all took him for a burgomaster sure of
his<br>
 authority, a worthy and kindly burgomaster like so many a
Fleming of<br>
 old times, whose homely features and characters have been
immortalized<br>
 by Flemish painters. The poorer passengers, therefore, received
him<br>
 with demonstrations of respect that provoked scornful tittering
at the<br>
 other end of the boat. An old soldier, inured to toil and
hardship,<br>
 gave up his place on the bench to the newcomer, and seated
himself on<br>
 the edge of the vessel, keeping his balance by planting his
feet<br>
 against one of those traverse beams, like the backbone of a
fish, that<br>
 hold the planks of a boat together. A young mother, who bore her
baby<br>
 in her arms, and seemed to belong to the working class in
Ostend,<br>
 moved aside to make room for the stranger. There was neither
servility<br>
 nor scorn in her manner of doing this; it was a simple sign of
the<br>
 goodwill by which the poor, who know by long experience the
value of a<br>
 service and the warmth that fellowship brings, give expression
to the<br>
 open-heartedness and the natural impulses of their souls; so
artlessly<br>
 do they reveal their good qualities and their defects. The
stranger<br>
 thanked her by a gesture full of gracious dignity, and took his
place<br>
 between the young mother and the old soldier. Immediately behind
him<br>
 sat a peasant and his son, a boy ten years of age. A beggar
woman,<br>
 old, wrinkled, and clad in rags, was crouching, with her almost
empty<br>
 wallet, on a great coil of rope that lay in the prow. One of
the<br>
 rowers, an old sailor, who had known her in the days of her
beauty and<br>
 prosperity, had let her come in "for the love of God," in
the<br>
 beautiful phrase that the common people use.</p>

<p>"Thank you kindly, Thomas," the old woman had said. "I will
say two<br>
 <i>Paters</i> and two <i>Aves</i> for you in my prayers
to-night."</p>

<p>The skipper blew his horn for the last time, looked along the
silent<br>
 shore, flung off the chain, ran along the side of the boat, and
took<br>
 up his position at the helm. He looked at the sky, and as soon
as they<br>
 were out in the open sea, he shouted to the men: "Pull away,
pull with<br>
 all your might! The sea is smiling at a squall, the witch! I can
feel<br>
 the swell by the way the rudder works, and the storm in my
wounds."</p>

<p>The nautical phrases, unintelligible to ears unused to the
sound of<br>
 the sea, seemed to put fresh energy into the oars; they kept
time<br>
 together, the rhythm of the movement was still even and steady,
but<br>
 quite unlike the previous manner of rowing; it was as if a
cantering<br>
 horse had broken into a gallop. The gay company seated in the
stern<br>
 amused themselves by watching the brawny arms, the tanned faces,
and<br>
 sparkling eyes of the rowers, the play of the tense muscles,
the<br>
 physical and mental forces that were being exerted to bring them
for a<br>
 trifling toll across the channel. So far from pitying the
rowers'<br>
 distress, they pointed out the men's faces to each other, and
laughed<br>
 at the grotesque expressions on the faces of the crew who
were<br>
 straining every muscle; but in the fore part of the boat the
soldier,<br>
 the peasant, and the old beggar woman watched the sailors with
the<br>
 sympathy naturally felt by toilers who live by the sweat of
their brow<br>
 and know the rough struggle, the strenuous excitement of effort.
These<br>
 folk, moreover, whose lives were spent in the open air, had all
seen<br>
 the warnings of danger in the sky, and their faces were grave.
The<br>
 young mother rocked her child, singing an old hymn of the Church
for a<br>
 lullaby.</p>

<p>"If we ever get there at all," the soldier remarked to the
peasant,<br>
 "it will be because the Almighty is bent on keeping us
alive."</p>

<p>"Ah! He is the Master," said the old woman, "but I think it
will be<br>
 His good pleasure to take us to Himself. Just look at that light
down<br>
 there . . ." and she nodded her head as she spoke towards the
sunset.</p>

<p>Streaks of fiery red glared from behind the masses of
crimson-flushed<br>
 brown cloud that seemed about to unloose a furious gale. There
was a<br>
 smothered murmur of the sea, a moaning sound that seemed to come
from<br>
 the depths, a low warning growl, such as a dog gives when he
only<br>
 means mischief as yet. After all, Ostend was not far away.
Perhaps<br>
 painting, like poetry, could not prolong the existence of the
picture<br>
 presented by sea and sky at that moment beyond the time of its
actual<br>
 duration. Art demands vehement contrasts, wherefore artists
usually<br>
 seek out Nature's most striking effects, doubtless because
they<br>
 despair of rendering the great and glorious charm of her daily
moods;<br>
 yet the human soul is often stirred as deeply by her calm as by
her<br>
 emotion, and by silence as by storm.</p>

<p>For a moment no one spoke on board the boat. Every one watched
that<br>
 sea and sky, either with some presentiment of danger, or because
they<br>
 felt the influence of the religious melancholy that takes
possession<br>
 of nearly all of us at the close of the day, the hour of prayer,
when<br>
 all nature is hushed save for the voices of the bells. The sea
gleamed<br>
 pale and wan, but its hues changed, and the surface took all
the<br>
 colors of steel. The sky was almost overspread with livid gray,
but<br>
 down in the west there were long narrow bars like streaks of
blood;<br>
 while lines of bright light in the eastern sky, sharp and clean
as if<br>
 drawn by the tip of a brush, were separated by folds of cloud,
like<br>
 the wrinkles on an old man's brow. The whole scene made a
background<br>
 of ashen grays and half-tints, in strong contrast to the
bale-fires of<br>
 the sunset. If written language might borrow of spoken language
some<br>
 of the bold figures of speech invented by the people, it might
be said<br>
 with the soldier that "the weather has been routed," or, as
the<br>
 peasant would say, "the sky glowered like an executioner."
Suddenly a<br>
 wind arose from the quarter of the sunset, and the skipper, who
never<br>
 took his eyes off the sea, saw the swell on the horizon line,
and<br>
 cried:</p>

<p>"Stop rowing!"</p>

<p>The sailors stopped immediately, and let their oars lie on the
water.</p>

<p>"The skipper is right," said Thomas coolly. A great wave
caught up the<br>
 boat, carried it high on its crest, only to plunge it, as it
were,<br>
 into the trough of the sea that seemed to yawn for them. At
this<br>
 mighty upheaval, this sudden outbreak of the wrath of the sea,
the<br>
 company in the stern turned pale, and sent up a terrible
cry.</p>

<p>"We are lost!"</p>

<p>"Oh, not yet!" said the skipper calmly.</p>

<p>As he spoke, the clouds immediately above their heads were
torn<br>
 asunder by the vehemence of the wind. The gray mass was rent
and<br>
 scattered east and west with ominous speed, a dim uncertain
light from<br>
 the rift in the sky fell full upon the boat, and the travelers
beheld<br>
 each other's faces. All of them, the noble and the wealthy,
the<br>
 sailors and the poor passengers alike, were amazed for a moment
by the<br>
 appearance of the last comer. His golden hair, parted upon his
calm,<br>
 serene forehead, fell in thick curls about his shoulders; and
his<br>
 face, sublime in its sweetness and radiant with divine love,
stood out<br>
 against the surrounding gloom. He had no contempt for death; he
knew<br>
 that he should not die. But if at the first the company in the
stern<br>
 forgot for a moment the implacable fury of the storm that
threatened<br>
 their lives, selfishness and their habits of life soon
prevailed<br>
 again.</p>

<p><br>
 "How lucky that stupid burgomaster is, not to see the risks we
are all<br>
 running! He is just like a dog, he will die without a struggle,"
said<br>
 the doctor.</p>

<p>He had scarcely pronounced this highly judicious dictum when
the storm<br>
 unloosed all its legions. The wind blew from every quarter of
the<br>
 heavens, the boat span round like a top, and the sea broke
in.</p>

<p>"Oh! my poor child! my poor child! . . . Who will save my
baby?" the<br>
 mother cried in a heart-rending voice.</p>

<p>"You yourself will save it," the stranger said.</p>

<p>The thrilling tones of that voice went to the young mother's
heart and<br>
 brought hope with them; she heard the gracious words through all
the<br>
 whistling of the wind and the shrieks of the passengers.</p>

<p>"Holy Virgin of Good Help, who art at Antwerp, I promise thee
a<br>
 thousand pounds of wax and a statue, if thou wilt rescue me
from<br>
 this!" cried the burgher, kneeling upon his bags of gold.</p>

<p>"The Virgin is no more at Antwerp than she is here," was the
doctor's<br>
 comment on this appeal.</p>

<p>"She is in heaven," said a voice that seemed to come from the
sea.</p>

<p>"Who said that?"</p>

<p>"'Tis the devil!" exclaimed the servant. "He is scoffing at
the Virgin<br>
 of Antwerp."</p>

<p>"Let us have no more of your Holy Virgin at present," the
skipper<br>
 cried to the passengers. "Put your hands to the scoops and bail
the<br>
 water out of the boat.--And the rest of you," he went on,
addressing<br>
 the sailors, "pull with all your might! Now is the time; in the
name<br>
 of the devil who is leaving you in this world, be your own
Providence!<br>
 Every one knows that the channel is fearfully dangerous; I have
been<br>
 to and fro across it these thirty years. Am I facing a storm for
the<br>
 first time to-night?"</p>

<p>He stood at the helm, and looked, as before, at his boat and
at the<br>
 sea and sky in turn.</p>

<p>"The skipper always laughs at everything," muttered
Thomas.</p>

<p>"Will God leave us to perish along with those wretched
creatures?"<br>
 asked the haughty damsel of the handsome cavalier.</p>

<p>"No, no, noble maiden. . . . Listen!" and he caught her by the
waist<br>
 and said in her ear, "I can swim, say nothing about it! I will
hold<br>
 you by your fair hair and bring you safely to the shore; but I
can<br>
 only save you."</p>

<p>The girl looked at her aged mother. The lady was on her
knees<br>
 entreating absolution of the Bishop, who did not heed her. In
the<br>
 beautiful eyes the knight read a vague feeling of filial piety,
and<br>
 spoke in a smothered voice.</p>

<p>"Submit yourself to the will of God. If it is His pleasure to
take<br>
 your mother to Himself, it will doubtless be for her
happiness--in<br>
 another world," he added, and his voice dropped still lower.
"And for<br>
 ours in this," he thought within himself.</p>

<p>The Dame of Rupelmonde was lady of seven fiefs beside the
barony of<br>
 Gavres.</p>

<p>The girl felt the longing for life in her heart, and for love
that<br>
 spoke through the handsome adventurer, a young miscreant who
haunted<br>
 churches in search of a prize, an heiress to marry, or ready
money.<br>
 The Bishop bestowed his benison on the waves, and bade them be
calm;<br>
 it was all that he could do. He thought of his concubine, and of
the<br>
 delicate feast with which she would welcome him; perhaps at that
very<br>
 moment she was bathing, perfuming herself, robing herself in
velvet,<br>
 fastening her necklace and her jeweled clasps; and the
perverse<br>
 Bishop, so far from thinking of the power of Holy Church, of his
duty<br>
 to comfort Christians and exhort them to trust in God, mingled
worldly<br>
 regrets and lover's sighs with the holy words of the breviary.
By the<br>
 dim light that shone on the pale faces of the company, it was
possible<br>
 to see their differing expressions as the boat was lifted high
in air<br>
 by a wave, to be cast back into the dark depths; the shallop
quivered<br>
 like a fragile leaf, the plaything of the north wind in the
autumn;<br>
 the hull creaked, it seemed ready to go to pieces. Fearful
shrieks<br>
 went up, followed by an awful silence.</p>

<p>There was a strange difference between the behavior of the
folk in the<br>
 bows and that of the rich or great people at the other end of
the<br>
 boat. The young mother clasped her infant tightly to her breast
every<br>
 time that a great wave threatened to engulf the fragile vessel;
but<br>
 she clung to the hope that the stranger's words had set in her
heart.<br>
 Each time that the eyes turned to his face she drew fresh faith
at the<br>
 sight, the strong faith of a helpless woman, a mother's faith.
She<br>
 lived by that divine promise, the loving words from his lips;
the<br>
 simple creature waited trustingly for them to be fulfilled,
and<br>
 scarcely feared the danger any longer.</p>

<p>The soldier, holding fast to the vessel's side, never took his
eyes<br>
 off the strange visitor. He copied on his own rough and
swarthy<br>
 features the imperturbability of the other's face, applying to
this<br>
 task the whole strength of a will and intelligence but
little<br>
 corrupted in the course of a life of mechanical and passive
obedience.<br>
 So emulous was he of a calm and tranquil courage greater than
his own,<br>
 that at last, perhaps unconsciously, something of that
mysterious<br>
 nature passed into his own soul. His admiration became an
instinctive<br>
 zeal for this man, a boundless love for and belief in him, such
a love<br>
 as soldiers feel for their leader when he has the power of
swaying<br>
 other men, when the halo of victories surrounds him, and the
magical<br>
 fascination of genius is felt in all that he does. The poor
outcast<br>
 was murmuring to herself:</p>

<p>"Ah! miserable wretch that I am! Have I not suffered enough to
expiate<br>
 the sins of my youth? Ah! wretched woman, why did you leave the
gay<br>
 life of a frivolous Frenchwoman? why did you devour the goods of
God<br>
 with churchmen, the substance of the poor with extortioners
and<br>
 fleecers of the poor? Oh! I have sinned indeed!--Oh my God! my
God!<br>
 let me finish my time in hell here in this world of misery."</p>

<p>And again she cried, "Holy Virgin, Mother of God, have pity
upon me!"</p>

<p>"Be comforted, mother. God is not a Lombard usurer. I may have
killed<br>
 people good and bad at random in my time, but I am not afraid of
the<br>
 resurrection."</p>

<p>"Ah! master Lancepesade, how happy those fair ladies are, to
be so<br>
 near to a bishop, a holy man! They will get absolution for
their<br>
 sins," said the old woman. "Oh! if I could only hear a priest
say to<br>
 me, 'Thy sins are forgiven!' I should believe it then."</p>

<p>The stranger turned towards her, and the goodness in his face
made her<br>
 tremble.</p>

<p>"Have faith," he said, "and you will be saved."</p>

<p>"May God reward you, good sir," she answered. "If what you say
is<br>
 true, I will go on pilgrimage barefooted to Our Lady of Loretto
to<br>
 pray to her for you and for me."</p>

<p>The two peasants, father and son, were silent, patient, and
submissive<br>
 to the will of God, like folk whose wont it is to fall in<br>
 instinctively with the ways of Nature like cattle. At the one
end of<br>
 the boat stood riches, pride, learning, debauchery, and
crime--human<br>
 society, such as art and thought and education and worldly
interests<br>
 and laws have made it; and at this end there was terror and
wailing,<br>
 innumerable different impulses all repressed by hideous
doubts--at<br>
 this end, and at this only, the agony of fear.</p>

<p>Above all these human lives stood a strong man, the skipper;
no doubts<br>
 assailed him, the chief, the king, the fatalist among them. He
was<br>
 trusting in himself rather than in Providence, crying, "Bail
away!"<br>
 instead of "Holy Virgin," defying the storm, in fact, and
struggling<br>
 with the sea like a wrestler.</p>

<p>But the helpless poor at the other end of the wherry! The
mother<br>
 rocking on her bosom the little one who smiled at the storm; the
woman<br>
 once so frivolous and gay, and now tormented with bitter
remorse; the<br>
 old soldier covered with scars, a mutilated life the sole reward
of<br>
 his unflagging loyalty and faithfulness. This veteran could
scarcely<br>
 count on the morsel of bread soaked in tears to keep the life in
him,<br>
 yet he was always ready to laugh, and went his way merrily,
happy when<br>
 he could drown his glory in the depths of a pot of beer, or
could tell<br>
 tales of the wars to the children who admired him, leaving his
future<br>
 with a light heart in the hands of God. Lastly, there were the
two<br>
 peasants, used to hardships and toil, labor incarnate, the labor
by<br>
 which the world lives. These simple folk were indifferent to
thought<br>
 and its treasures, ready to sink them all in a belief; and their
faith<br>
 was but so much the more vigorous because they had never
disputed<br>
 about it nor analyzed it. Such a nature is a virgin soil,
conscience<br>
 has not been tampered with, feeling is deep and strong;
repentance,<br>
 trouble, love, and work have developed, purified, concentrated,
and<br>
 increased their force of will a hundred times, the will--the one
thing<br>
 in man that resembles what learned doctors call the Soul.</p>

<p>The boat, guided by the well-nigh miraculous skill of the
steersman,<br>
 came almost within sight of Ostend, when, not fifty paces from
the<br>
 shore, she was suddenly struck by a heavy sea and capsized.
The<br>
 stranger with the light about his head spoke to this little
world of<br>
 drowning creatures:</p>

<p>"Those who have faith shall be saved; let them follow me!"</p>

<p>He stood upright, and walked with a firm step upon the waves.
The<br>
 young mother at once took her child in her arms, and followed at
his<br>
 side across the sea. The soldier too sprang up, saying in his
homely<br>
 fashion, "Ah! <i>nom d'un pipe</i>! I would follow <i>you</i> to
the devil;" and<br>
 without seeming astonished by it, he walked on the water. The
worn-out<br>
 sinner, believing in the omnipotence of God, also followed
the<br>
 stranger.</p>

<p>The two peasants said to each other, "If they are walking on
the sea,<br>
 why should we not do as they do?" and they also arose and
hastened<br>
 after the others. Thomas tried to follow, but his faith
tottered; he<br>
 sank in the sea more than once, and rose again, but the third
time he<br>
 also walked on the sea. The bold steersman clung like a remora
to the<br>
 wreck of his boat. The miser had had faith, and had risen to go,
but<br>
 he tried to take his gold with him, and it was his gold that
dragged<br>
 him down to the bottom. The learned man had scoffed at the
charlatan<br>
 and at the fools who listened to him; and when he heard the
mysterious<br>
 stranger propose to the passengers that they should walk on the
waves,<br>
 he began to laugh, and the ocean swallowed him. The girl was
dragged<br>
 down into the depths by her lover. The Bishop and the older lady
went<br>
 to the bottom, heavily laden with sins, it may be, but still
more<br>
 heavily laden with incredulity and confidence in idols, weighted
down<br>
 by devotion, into which alms-deeds and true religion entered
but<br>
 little.</p>

<p><br>
 The faithful flock, who walked with a firm step high and dry
above the<br>
 surge, heard all about them the dreadful whistling of the blast;
great<br>
 billows broke across their path, but an irresistible force cleft
a way<br>
 for them through the sea. These believing ones saw through the
spray a<br>
 dim speck of light flickering in the window of a fisherman's hut
on<br>
 the shore, and each one, as he pushed on bravely towards the
light,<br>
 seemed to hear the voice of his fellow crying, "Courage!"
through all<br>
 the roaring of the surf; yet no one had spoken a word--so
absorbed was<br>
 each by his own peril. In this way they reached the shore.</p>

<p>When they were all seated near the fisherman's fire, they
looked round<br>
 in vain for their guide with the light about him. The sea washed
up<br>
 the steersman at the base of the cliff on which the cottage
stood; he<br>
 was clinging with might and main to the plank as a sailor can
cling<br>
 when death stares him in the face; the MAN went down and rescued
the<br>
 almost exhausted seaman; then he said, as he held out a
succoring hand<br>
 above the man's head:</p>

<p>"Good, for this once; but do not try it again; the example
would be<br>
 too bad."</p>

<p>He took the skipper on his shoulders, and carried him to
the<br>
 fisherman's door; knocked for admittance for the exhausted man;
then,<br>
 when the door of the humble refuge opened, the Saviour
disappeared.</p>

<p>The Convent of Mercy was built for sailors on this spot, where
for<br>
 long afterwards (so it was said) the footprints of Jesus Christ
could<br>
 be seen in the sand; but in 1793, at the time of the French
invasion,<br>
 the monks carried away this precious relic, that bore witness to
the<br>
 Saviour's last visit to earth.</p>

<p>There at the convent I found myself shortly after the
Revolution of<br>
 1830. I was weary of life. If you had asked me the reason of
my<br>
 despair, I should have found it almost impossible to give it,
so<br>
 languid had grown the soul that was melted within me. The west
wind<br>
 had slackened the springs of my intelligence. A cold gray light
poured<br>
 down from the heavens, and the murky clouds that passed overhead
gave<br>
 a boding look to the land; all these things, together with
the<br>
 immensity of the sea, said to me, "Die to-day or die to-morrow,
still<br>
 must we not die?" And then--I wandered on, musing on the
doubtful<br>
 future, on my blighted hopes. Gnawed by these gloomy thoughts,
I<br>
 turned mechanically into the convent church, with the gray
towers that<br>
 loomed like ghosts though the sea mists. I looked round with
no<br>
 kindling of the imagination at the forest of columns, at the
slender<br>
 arches set aloft upon the leafy capitals, a delicate labyrinth
of<br>
 sculpture. I walked with careless eyes along the side aisles
that<br>
 opened out before me like vast portals, ever turning upon
their<br>
 hinges. It was scarcely possible to see, by the dim light of
the<br>
 autumn day, the sculptured groinings of the roof, the delicate
and<br>
 clean-cut lines of the mouldings of the graceful pointed arches.
The<br>
 organ pipes were mute. There was no sound save the noise of my
own<br>
 footsteps to awaken the mournful echoes lurking in the dark
chapels. I<br>
 sat down at the base of one of the four pillars that supported
the<br>
 tower, near the choir. Thence I could see the whole of the
building. I<br>
 gazed, and no ideas connected with it arose in my mind. I saw
without<br>
 seeing the mighty maze of pillars, the great rose windows that
hung<br>
 like a network suspended as by a miracle in air above the
vast<br>
 doorways. I saw the doors at the end of the side aisles, the
aerial<br>
 galleries, the stained glass windows framed in archways, divided
by<br>
 slender columns, fretted into flower forms and trefoil by
fine<br>
 filigree work of carved stone. A dome of glass at the end of the
choir<br>
 sparkled as if it had been built of precious stones set
cunningly. In<br>
 contrast to the roof with its alternating spaces of whiteness
and<br>
 color, the two aisles lay to right and left in shadow so deep
that the<br>
 faint gray outlines of their hundred shafts were scarcely
visible in<br>
 the gloom. I gazed at the marvelous arcades, the scroll-work,
the<br>
 garlands, the curving lines, and arabesques interwoven and
interlaced,<br>
 and strangely lighted, until by sheer dint of gazing my
perceptions<br>
 became confused, and I stood upon the borderland between
illusion and<br>
 reality, taken in the snare set for the eyes, and almost
light-headed<br>
 by reason of the multitudinous changes of the shapes about
me.</p>

<p>Imperceptibly a mist gathered about the carven stonework, and
I only<br>
 beheld it through a haze of fine golden dust, like the motes
that<br>
 hover in the bars of sunlight slanting through the air of a
chamber.<br>
 Suddenly the stone lacework of the rose windows gleamed through
this<br>
 vapor that had made all forms so shadowy. Every moulding, the
edges of<br>
 every carving, the least detail of the sculpture was dipped in
silver.<br>
 The sunlight kindled fires in the stained windows, their rich
colors<br>
 sent out glowing sparks of light. The shafts began to tremble,
the<br>
 capitals were gently shaken. A light shudder as of delight ran
through<br>
 the building, the stones were loosened in their setting, the
wall-<br>
 spaces swayed with graceful caution. Here and there a ponderous
pier<br>
 moved as solemnly as a dowager when she condescends to complete
a<br>
 quadrille at the close of a ball. A few slender and graceful
columns,<br>
 their heads adorned with wreaths of trefoil, began to laugh and
dance<br>
 here and there. Some of the pointed arches dashed at the tall
lancet<br>
 windows, who, like ladies of the Middle Ages, wore the
armorial<br>
 bearings of their houses emblazoned on their golden robes. The
dance<br>
 of the mitred arcades with the slender windows became like a
fray at a<br>
 tourney.</p>

<p>In another moment every stone in the church vibrated, without
leaving<br>
 its place; for the organ-pipes spoke, and I heard divine
music<br>
 mingling with the songs of angels, and unearthly harmony,
accompanied<br>
 by the deep notes of the bells, that boomed as the giant towers
rocked<br>
 and swayed on their square bases. This strange Sabbath seemed to
me<br>
 the most natural thing in the world; and I, who had seen Charles
X.<br>
 hurled from his throne, was no longer amazed by anything. Nay,
I<br>
 myself was gently swaying with a see-saw movement that
influenced my<br>
 nerves pleasurably in a manner of which it is impossible to give
any<br>
 idea. Yet in the midst of this heated riot, the cathedral choir
felt<br>
 cold as if it were a winter day, and I became aware of a
multitude of<br>
 women, robed in white, silent, and impassive, sitting there. The
sweet<br>
 incense smoke that arose from the censers was grateful to my
soul. The<br>
 tall wax candles flickered. The lectern, gay as a chanter undone
by<br>
 the treachery of wine, was skipping about like a peal of
Chinese<br>
 bells.</p>

<p><br>
 Then I knew that the whole cathedral was whirling round so fast
that<br>
 everything appeared to be undisturbed. The colossal Figure on
the<br>
 crucifix above the altar smiled upon me with a mingled malice
and<br>
 benevolence that frightened me; I turned my eyes away, and
marveled at<br>
 the bluish vapor that slid across the pillars, lending to them
an<br>
 indescribable charm. Then some graceful women's forms began to
stir on<br>
 the friezes. The cherubs who upheld the heavy columns shook out
their<br>
 wings. I felt myself uplifted by some divine power that steeped
me in<br>
 infinite joy, in a sweet and languid rapture. I would have given
my<br>
 life, I think, to have prolonged these phantasmagoria for a
little,<br>
 but suddenly a shrill voice clamored in my ears:</p>

<p>"Awake and follow me!"</p>

<p>A withered woman took my hand in hers; its icy coldness crept
through<br>
 every nerve. The bones of her face showed plainly through the
sallow,<br>
 almost olive-tinted wrinkles of the skin. The shrunken, ice-cold
old<br>
 woman wore a black robe, which she trailed in the dust, and at
her<br>
 throat there was something white, which I dared not examine. I
could<br>
 scarcely see her wan and colorless eyes, for they were fixed in
a<br>
 stare upon the heavens. She drew me after her along the
aisles,<br>
 leaving a trace of her presence in the ashes that she shook from
her<br>
 dress. Her bones rattled as she walked, like the bones of a
skeleton;<br>
 and as we went I heard behind me the tinkling of a little bell,
a<br>
 thin, sharp sound that rang through my head like the notes of
a<br>
 harmonica.</p>

<p>"Suffer!" she cried, "suffer! So it must be!"</p>

<p>We came out of the church; we went through the dirtiest
streets of the<br>
 town, till we came at last to a dingy dwelling, and she bade me
enter<br>
 in. She dragged me with her, calling to me in a harsh, tuneless
voice<br>
 like a cracked bell:</p>

<p>"Defend me! defend me!"</p>

<p>Together we went up a winding staircase. She knocked at a door
in the<br>
 darkness, and a mute, like some familiar of the Inquisition,
opened to<br>
 her. In another moment we stood in a room hung with ancient,
ragged<br>
 tapestry, amid piles of old linen, crumpled muslin, and gilded
brass.</p>

<p>"Behold the wealth that shall endure for ever!" said she.</p>

<p>I shuddered with horror; for just then, by the light of a tall
torch<br>
 and two altar candles, I saw distinctly that this woman was
fresh from<br>
 the graveyard. She had no hair. I turned to fly. She raised
her<br>
 fleshless arm and encircled me with a band of iron set with
spikes,<br>
 and as she raised it a cry went up all about us, the cry of
millions<br>
 of voices--the shouting of the dead!</p>

<p>"It is my purpose to make thee happy for ever," she said.
"Thou art my<br>
 son."</p>

<p>We were sitting before the hearth, the ashes lay cold upon it;
the old<br>
 shrunken woman grasped my hand so tightly in hers that I could
not<br>
 choose but stay. I looked fixedly at her, striving to read the
story<br>
 of her life from the things among which she was crouching. Had
she<br>
 indeed any life in her? It was a mystery. Yet I saw plainly that
once<br>
 she must have been young and beautiful; fair, with all the charm
of<br>
 simplicity, perfect as some Greek statue, with the brow of a
vestal.</p>

<p>"Ah! ah!" I cried, "now I know thee! Miserable woman, why hast
thou<br>
 prostituted thyself? In the age of thy passions, in the time of
thy<br>
 prosperity, the grace and purity of thy youth were
forgotten.<br>
 Forgetful of thy heroic devotion, thy pure life, thy abundant
faith,<br>
 thou didst resign thy primitive power and thy spiritual
supremacy for<br>
 fleshly power. Thy linen vestments, thy couch of moss, the cell
in the<br>
 rock, bright with rays of the Light Divine, was forsaken; thou
hast<br>
 sparkled with diamonds, and shone with the glitter of luxury
and<br>
 pride. Then, grown bold and insolent, seizing and overturning
all<br>
 things in thy course like a courtesan eager for pleasure in her
days<br>
 of splendor, thou hast steeped thyself in blood like some
queen<br>
 stupefied by empery. Dost thou not remember to have been dull
and<br>
 heavy at times, and the sudden marvelous lucidity of other
moments; as<br>
 when Art emerges from an orgy? Oh! poet, painter, and singer,
lover of<br>
 splendid ceremonies and protector of the arts, was thy
friendship for<br>
 art perchance a caprice, that so thou shouldst sleep beneath<br>
 magnificent canopies? Was there not a day when, in thy
fantastic<br>
 pride, though chastity and humility were prescribed to thee,
thou<br>
 hadst brought all things beneath thy feet, and set thy foot on
the<br>
 necks of princes; when earthly dominion, and wealth, and the
mind of<br>
 man bore thy yoke? Exulting in the abasement of humanity, joying
to<br>
 witness the uttermost lengths to which man's folly would go,
thou hast<br>
 bidden thy lovers walk on all fours, and required of them their
lands<br>
 and wealth, nay, even their wives if they were worth aught to
thee.<br>
 Thou hast devoured millions of men without a cause; thou hast
flung<br>
 away lives like sand blown by the wind from West to East. Thou
hast<br>
 come down from the heights of thought to sit among the kings of
men.<br>
 Woman! instead of comforting men, thou hast tormented and
afflicted<br>
 them! Knowing that thou couldst ask and have, thou hast
demanded--<br>
 blood! A little flour surely should have contented thee,
accustomed as<br>
 thou hast been to live on bread and to mingle water with thy
wine.<br>
 Unlike all others in all things, formerly thou wouldst bid thy
lovers<br>
 fast, and they obeyed. Why should thy fancies have led thee to
require<br>
 things impossible? Why, like a courtesan spoiled by her lovers,
hast<br>
 thou doted on follies, and left those undeceived who sought to
explain<br>
 and justify all thy errors? Then came the days of thy later
passions,<br>
 terrible like the love of a woman of forty years, with a fierce
cry<br>
 thou hast sought to clasp the whole universe in one last
embrace--and<br>
 thy universe recoiled from thee!</p>

<p><br>
 "Then old men succeeded to thy young lovers; decrepitude came to
thy<br>
 feet and made thee hideous. Yet, even then, men with the eagle
power<br>
 of vision said to thee in a glance, 'Thou shalt perish
ingloriously,<br>
 because thou hast fallen away, because thou hast broken the vows
of<br>
 thy maidenhood. The angel with peace written on her forehead,
who<br>
 should have shed light and joy along her path, has been a
Messalina,<br>
 delighting in the circus, in debauchery, and abuse of power. The
days<br>
 of thy virginity cannot return; henceforward thou shalt be
subject to<br>
 a master. Thy hour has come; the hand of death is upon thee. Thy
heirs<br>
 believe that thou art rich; they will kill thee and find
nothing. Yet<br>
 try at least to fling away this raiment no longer in fashion; be
once<br>
 more as in the days of old!--Nay, thou art dead, and by thy own
deed!'</p>

<p>"Is not this thy story?" so I ended. "Decrepit, toothless,
shivering<br>
 crone, now forgotten, going thy ways without so much as a glance
from<br>
 passers-by! Why art thou still alive? What doest thou in that
beggar's<br>
 garb, uncomely and desired of none? Where are thy riches?--for
what<br>
 were they spent? Where are thy treasures?--what great deeds hast
thou<br>
 done?"</p>

<p>At this demand, the shriveled woman raised her bony form,
flung off<br>
 her rags, and grew tall and radiant, smiling as she broke forth
from<br>
 the dark chrysalid sheath. Then like a butterfly, this
diaphanous<br>
 creature emerged, fair and youthful, clothed in white linen, an
Indian<br>
 from creation issuing her palms. Her golden hair rippled over
her<br>
 shoulders, her eyes glowed, a bright mist clung about her, a
ring of<br>
 gold hovered above her head, she shook the flaming blade of a
sword<br>
 towards the spaces of heaven.</p>

<p>"See and believe!" she cried.</p>

<p>And suddenly I saw, afar off, many thousands of cathedrals
like the<br>
 one that I had just quitted; but these were covered with
pictures and<br>
 with frescoes, and I heard them echo with entrancing music.
Myriads of<br>
 human creatures flocked to these great buildings, swarming about
them<br>
 like ants on an ant-heap. Some were eager to rescue books
from<br>
 oblivion or to copy manuscripts, others were helping the poor,
but<br>
 nearly all were studying. Up above this countless multitude rose
giant<br>
 statues that they had erected in their midst, and by the gleams
of a<br>
 strange light from some luminary as powerful as the sun, I read
the<br>
 inscriptions on the bases of the statues--Science, History,<br>
 Literature.</p>

<p>The light died out. Again I faced the young girl. Gradually
she<br>
 slipped into the dreary sheath, into the ragged cere-cloths,
and<br>
 became an aged woman again. Her familiar brought her a little
dust,<br>
 and she stirred it into the ashes of her chafing-dish, for the
weather<br>
 was cold and stormy; and then he lighted for her, whose palaces
had<br>
 been lit with thousands of wax-tapers, a little cresset, that
she<br>
 might see to read her prayers through the hours of night.</p>

<p>"There is no faith left in the earth! . . ." she said.</p>

<p>In such a perilous plight did I behold the fairest and the
greatest,<br>
 the truest and most life-giving of all Powers.</p>

<p>"Wake up, sir, the doors are just about to be shut," said a
hoarse<br>
 voice. I turned and beheld the beadle's ugly countenance; the
man was<br>
 shaking me by the arm, and the cathedral lay wrapped in shadows
as a<br>
 man is wrapped in his cloak.</p>

<p>"Belief," I said to myself, "is Life! I have just witnessed
the<br>
 funeral of a monarchy, now we must defend the church."</p>

<p>PARIS, February 183l.</p>

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
